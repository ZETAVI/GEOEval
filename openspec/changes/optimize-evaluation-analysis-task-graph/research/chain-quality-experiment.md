# M4 Chain Quality Experiment

## Question and authority

Does a clearer semantic task and sufficient evidence context improve raw
generation enough to justify a runtime change? The owner's 2026-09-05 feedback
approves preparing this comparison, not accepting a topology in advance.
The owner authorized the first batch and then explicitly approved the generic
Beijing endpoint for this isolated experiment only. The earlier
[zero-request preflight](https://github.com/ZETAVI/GEOEval/issues/42#issuecomment-5550245255)
is historical; the executed first-batch result is recorded below. The product
Worker's workspace-dedicated endpoint restriction remains unchanged.
Subsequent synthesis batches require their own frozen scope.

## First package: Parser instruction only

- P0: current main Parser instruction/profile 2.2.0 and model contract @5.
- P1: [experimental instruction](../../../../apps/backend/geo-intelligence/experiments/m4-parser-instruction.json),
  experiment version 1.0.0; production assets are untouched.
- Inputs: existing fictional P01/P03/P05/P07 fixtures from the S6 manifest.
- Each fixture receives P0/P1 once, with order counterbalanced across fixtures.
- Maximum eight Qwen3.8 Flash calls, interpretation route @2, low reasoning,
  same input and strict output Schema, no fallback, sampling or automatic retry.
- First transport, identity, structure or semantic failure stops the batch.
  Review before any resumption; unused calls are not permission for another batch.
- No customer data, business database writes or telemetry export.
- No customer SLA or fixed currency ceiling is claimed. Preserve actual usage;
  route/request-count limits are explicit, and timeout/request scope stays frozen.

The [builder](../../../../apps/backend/src/ai-execution/controlled-validation/m4-parser-comparison.ts)
reuses existing fixtures and the existing stop-on-failure/private-evidence
executor. Confirmation hashes actual instructions, inputs, schemas and route
definitions, rather than version labels alone. No application startup imports it.
Use a real adapter with telemetry disabled only after authorization; plan mode
requires no credentials, database or network.

From repository root, the credential-free plan is:

```bash
pnpm --filter @geoeval/backend exec node --import tsx --input-type=module -e 'import {m4ParserComparisonPlan} from "./src/ai-execution/controlled-validation/m4-parser-comparison.ts"; console.log(JSON.stringify(m4ParserComparisonPlan(), null, 2))'
```

Freeze the reviewed commit and confirmation together. Runtime execution is an
explicit call to the exported executor using this exact confirmation. Store
evidence under an ignored, task-owned directory, directories 0700/files 0600;
retain through decision/review and record the later cleanup owner. Raw evidence
does not belong in an Issue or PR. Save the exact plan alongside the results.

## Outcome review

| Dimension | Observe | Changed action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raw structure | Model Schema validity before projection | Output description/Schema candidate, not more recovery |
| Raw semantics | Correct subject, mention, original order, attribution, negation and qualifying facts | Diagnose the precise input/task ambiguity |
| Useful evidence | Key supported observations and competitor candidates retained; exact excerpts support meaning | Revise extraction/context if facts are missing or distorted |
| Customer reading | Faithful, complete enough, focused and readable prose | Change task/examples if generation itself is poor |
| Projection | Accepted/rejected, discarded facts, position normalization and card fallback | Report recovery separately; do not credit it as model quality |
| Efficiency | Wall time, usage and number of calls, with failure reason | Compare only matched conditions; no production percentile claim |

The existing validator checks selected fixture facts, not all prose. Machine
ACCEPTED is provisional until raw human-readable results are inspected. Preserve
P0/P1 failures equally. Do not feed observed holdout answers into Prompt examples.
Four fixtures cannot establish broad stability; select one later small holdout
that could disprove the proposed mechanism before activation.

## Following packages, not yet executable

1. Diagnose any missing Parser context using frozen v3 data and an explicit
   subject-identification projection. Do not indiscriminately include customer
   claims or change quote representation without a failing example.
2. Compare current-main and improved one-call synthesis packages. Reuse #41
   compact references, but preserve task-relevant source excerpts and name
   context; label joint Prompt/context changes as package comparisons.
3. Compare adequate-context one-call and split tasks on the exact same accepted
   interpretations. Review consistency between grouping and prose. Only test a
   sequential alternative if a real dependency or grounding gap changes the choice.
4. Use matched replay to separate architecture effects from changed upstream
   Query/Parser output. After selection, perform one integrated downstream check
   and later the representative #39 4x5 under separate sampling authorization.

Freeze contracts and budgets for each later package before real calls. Do not
convert the historical twelve-minute run or old Parser recovery count into
current-version evidence. Actual report-path acceptance precedes #41 closure.

## First real batch result — 2026-09-05

- Tested revision: `8a717eac621206b04b0222b95c27f23987af4cbc`.
- Exact confirmation: `26088fd63d0acc7761666d3ac6de864ff85cfe4fe8a009b331d4e90a903e9ff0`.
- Endpoint: `https://dashscope.aliyuncs.com/compatible-mode/v1/chat/completions`.
- Isolated adapter execution only; no Worker startup, business database,
  telemetry, acquisition, Hy3 or runtime configuration change.
- Executed 1/8 requests: P01-P0, the current-main Prompt. First failure stopped
  the batch. P1 and all later cases are **not run**.
- Provider succeeded with matching `qwen3.8-flash`, `finish_reason=stop`, 8,720 ms.
- Usage: 628 prompt + 445 completion = 1,073 total tokens. Reasoning details are
  preserved as provider data and are not added again to this total.

### Evidence matrix

| Claim | Retained evidence | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Selected generic endpoint works for this request | Successful response and exact model identity | Passed; not a production capacity or dedicated-endpoint comparison |
| Provider receives the full intended task | Sanitized request exactly matches input, instruction and Schema; strict mode and low effort retained | Passed |
| Raw output conforms to the model Schema | Raw output parses successfully | Passed |
| Raw result completes the extraction task | Mention=true, position=2 and fluent card prose; mention/position evidence, otherBrands and observations all empty | Failed |
| Current product accepts this output | Projector rejects missing open-position evidence | Failed as intended |
| Candidate Prompt improves quality | No P1 request was made | Not verified |

### Diagnosis and next discriminating action

The proven failure is incomplete structured extraction despite correct coarse
classification and readable prose. The Schema permits empty evidence arrays
independently of mentioned/position; local validation catches the inconsistent
combination afterwards. The output also omits two explicit competing brands.
Transport, input loss, Schema loss and token-limit truncation are not supported
by this retained request/response.

Offline counterfactual only: adding the exact second list line as position
evidence makes the domain projection accept, but the unchanged fixture still
fails because competitors are missing. The real output was not modified or
accepted. Thus filling one evidence gap would hide a broader extraction omission.

Ranked hypotheses for later comparisons:

1. The task and field contract let coarse classification/prose dominate full
   evidence extraction. Compare the already-frozen P1 on the same P01 input first.
2. Empty-field semantics do not distinguish no evidence from unfinished work.
   If P1 also fails, compare a coherent evidence-first output contract at its
   explicit owning decision boundary rather than add another recovery rule.
3. Low reasoning may affect extraction completeness. Change effort only after
   the instruction comparison, so model/effort and Prompt effects stay separate.

These hypotheses do not establish why the model omitted the fields or prove a
new Prompt, Schema or topology superior. Do not rewrite P1 using this result
before its paired comparison; further calls follow the stop-and-review boundary.

#42 owns retention through the comparison/review decision. Keep the current
worktree and evidence; review exact targets before cleanup at experiment close.
No customer result, current spec or production behavior changed.

## Resumed instruction comparison — 2026-09-05

After the owner requested continuing from real evidence, the remaining frozen
cases were resumed at ordinal 2, without repeating P0 or changing P1.

| Arm | Model/Schema | Latency | Input/output/total tokens | Raw extraction | Acceptance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0, first batch | Qwen3.8 low / @5 | 8,720 ms | 628 / 445 / 1,073 | Correct mention and position; empty evidence, competitors and observations | Rejected |
| P1, resumed batch | Same | 11,231 ms | 710 / 614 / 1,324 | Same omissions; displayed forms also empty, though prose names the target and competitors | Rejected |

The resumed batch stopped after one request. Across the original eight-case
plan, 2/8 cases were executed in two authorized stages; all later cases remain
not run. Each arm has only one observation. This disproves a success claim for
P1 on P01, not a universal claim about Prompt engineering or relative latency.
The next action is an evidence-first interface candidate, not more appended
prohibitions or a production guard change; see the active design.

### Evidence lineage audit and next package

The inspected retained #41 manifests are Y02/Y03 and fictional Parser fixtures,
not platform acquisitions. Historical Parser diagnostic scripts reference old
database runs, rather than retained answer artifacts; their old execution
worktree is gone. No reusable acquisition artifact was located in the inspected
main/#41/#44 evidence paths. This is a bounded search result, not proof that every
historical answer has been deleted. Do not call these fixtures a real sampling
chain or restore old development databases merely for testing.

The proposed max-three-call real chain uses the exact accepted open Query from
[Query review](../../archive/2026-09-04-implement-ai-query-generator/real-query-review.md):
“想找能做抖音和小红书广告代理的营销策划公司，广州天河猎德社区附近有哪些值得比较？”
Target identity is 互动派科技股份有限公司. The acquisition uses the current
Qwen sampling route (qwen3.7-flash, natural objectivity profile and automatic
search); parsing uses Qwen3.8 Flash low. The requested scope is one acquisition
plus P0 and the evidence-first candidate over the same unchanged answer.

Do not claim to rerun Brand/Amap/Query generation: the archived accepted Query
is reused. The two parsing outcomes are examined separately after each call;
no automatic semantic repair or retry is authorized. Reject an invalid
acquisition/transport identity before any parser call. Full report/synthesis
claims still require accepted sample sets and later bounded evidence.
